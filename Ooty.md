            Economy
            Tea plantations in Ooty
            Ooty is a market town for the surrounding area, which is still largely dependent on agriculture. Vegetables
            cultivated include potato, carrot, cabbage and cauliflower and fruits include peach, plum, pear and
            strawberry.[65] There is a daily wholesale auction of these products at the Ooty Municipal Market.[citation
            needed] Dairy farming has long been present in the area, and there is a cooperative dairy manufacturing
            cheese
            and skimmed milk powder.[66] Floriculture and sericulture are also practised, as is the cultivation of
            mushrooms. The local area is known for tea cultivation. Nilgiri tea is a black tea variety unique to the
            region.[67]
            Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) metre gauge railway in Nilgiris district, connecting
            Udagamandalam and Mettupalayam. The Nilgiri Railway Company was formed in 1885, and the Mettupalayam-Coonoor
            section of the track was opened for traffic on 15 June 1899. The railway was operated by the Madras Railway
            until 31 December 1907, when it was handed over to the South Indian Railway. The line from Coonoor to Ooty
            was
            completed in 1908.[71][72] Operated currently by the Southern Railway zone of Indian Railways, it is the
            only
            rack railway in India and operates on its own fleet of steam locomotives between Coonoor and
            Udagamandalam.[73]
            In July 2005, UNESCO added the Nilgiri Mountain Railway as an extension to the World Heritage Site of
            Mountain
            Railways of India.[72]
